# CampusTrade 📚  | Buy. Sell. Trade. Sustain.

CampusTrade is a community-driven marketplace exclusively for college students to buy, sell, and trade goods within their own campus. Whether it’s textbooks, electronics or lab equipment — if it’s useful to students, it belongs on CampusTrade.

Too often, students spend money on brand-new items without realizing someone on the same campus is trying to sell the exact same thing — cheaper and barely used. CampusTrade connects these students, creating a sustainable ecosystem where resources are reused, money is saved, and connections are made.
